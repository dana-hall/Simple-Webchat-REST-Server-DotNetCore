# Simple-Webchat-REST-Server-DotNetCore
Standalone simple REST server written in C# using .NET Core.  Used with the React webchat project

Mongo DB is used for the database.
To read messages a simple polling on a timer is used.
This was written simply as a learning exercise.  Unit tests will be added later as well as web sockets to replace the polling for messages.
